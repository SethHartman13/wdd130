        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this website is to provide a database-styled website to better organize notes used in online
            tutoring. This would help streamline the process of grabbing notes as all the notes the tutor would ever
            need would be within two clicks off the main page. To maintain academic integrity if a student did obtain
            the website that the tutor uses, I am going to institute a password to ensure no unauthorized users get
            access to
            completed assignments.</p> <!-- change this -->


        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>My intended audience is quite honestly myself. Though this website can be altered in terms of content and
            unit organization to be given to other online tutors so that they too can organize their own notes and
            tools. I could easily see this also be used for students who are needing a better way to organize notes and
            tools that their professor has provided them, though it would require personalization for each user that
            requests a website like this.

            I have been a tutor for the school since the beginning of Winter 2022 semester and I have enjoyed teaching
            students about the Engineering Mechanics regarding Statics. I remember taking ME 201 back in Spring 2021
            semester and found it frustrating at times not understanding all the topics without spending hours upon
            hours studying and unable to bounce ideas off another person to truly understand what I am learning. I have
            put together this website to allow a tutor like me to be able to access notes to allow students to learn and
            grow without unnecessary complications when it comes to filing management.

        <h3>Unit 1</h3>
        <p>
            Unit 2 covers three main topics: Cartesian Vectors, Vector angles (alpha, beta, gamma), and angles between
            two vectors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cartesian vector notation is a notation that shows how much of a vector is in all 3 dimensions. Normal
            vectors typically are shown in magnitude form, which doesn’t tell us where the vector goes. We also learn
            how to do addition with cartesian vectors. All of this is taught in HW 2.1.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vector angles help tell us where a vector is pointed without a coordinate grid. Alpha is associated with the
            angle of the vector in relation to the x-axis. Beta is associated with the angle of the vector in relation
            to the y-axis. Finally, Gamma is associated with the angle of the vector in relation to the z-axis. This is
            covered in HW 2.2.
        </p>
        <p>
            Angles between two vectors are typically one of the lesser-used concepts within engineering, but
            nevertheless, it is taught in this class. We learn to calculate the direct angle between two vectors or even
            between a vector and a line. We ignore alpha, beta, and gamma as we are getting the 3-D angle, rather than
            2-D angles. This concept is covered in HW 2.3.

        <h3>Unit 3</h3>
        <p>
            Unit 3 covers three main topics: Related force vectors with stiff members or ropes(2-D), related force
            vectors with springs (2-D), and related force vectors with stiff members or ropes(3-D).
        </p>
        <p>
            As an engineer, an important step is to learn how to calculate vectors where one is related to the other.
            Typically, 2 forces are unknown, while we use components to set up a multi-variable equation solver, in
            which we solve simultaneously. This is covered in HW 3.1, while it is expanded into 3-D in HW 3.3.
        </p>
        <p>
            Engineers interact with many different materials and different configurations. Doing related force vectors
            with springs just relates to the concept of the stretching of springs creating a tensional force. There are
            two factors that dictate the strength of the force: the spring coefficient and the change in spring length.
            This is covered in HW 3.2
