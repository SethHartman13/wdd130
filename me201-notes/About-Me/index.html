            Hello Everyone! To start things off, I am the youngest of 9 children. I currently live
            in Rexburg, Idaho. I am originally from Bountiful, Utah, but I usually say that I am from Pocatello, Idaho. I am currently unmarried, but I am currently engaged to my wonderful sweetheart Kim. 
        </p>
        <p>   
            We have plans to be sealed in the Pocatello Temple on July 29th.

        </h3>
        <p>
            I served in the Canada Edmonton Mission from July 2019 - April 2020. My mission was unfortunately cut short. Two of my favorite hobbies are to play DnD and do foil fencing. The difference between foil and sabre, is I am doing the stabbing kind.

            I am 20 years old, I am turning 21 on June 13th.

            I am excited to take this class as I remember taking web design back in high school. I can't wait to relearn what I have already forgotten.
